### What I‚Äôve been working on
I‚Äôve been wrapping up my work on the new [Common Knowledge website](https://commonknowledge.coop/) with tasks like integrating [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) for product analytics, switching the domain over from the staging site to production and fixing some bugs that came out of the QA process. I also set up a [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) sandbox site to test integrating an existing multisite WordPress installation with a modern CI/CD process and version control. 

### What I‚Äôve been learning
This month I‚Äôve been learning how to:
- add [private GitHub repositories](https://kraftner.com/en/blog/handling-authentication-with-composer-and-private-github-repositories/) as dependencies in Composer
- use [Tocbot](https://github.com/tscanlin/tocbot) to build a table of contents from headings in an HTML document
- create [custom template tags and filters](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/custom-template-tags/) in Django
- use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to slice, filter, map and transform JSON data 
- use a [named tuple](https://realpython.com/python-namedtuple/) in Python to create tuple subclasses with named fields

### What‚Äôs next
In March I‚Äôll be continuing the migration of the 350.org WordPress digital estate over to Bedrock. I‚Äôll be picking up support tickets on projects like [Smart Forests](https://atlas.smartforests.net/en-gb/), the [Left Book Club](https://leftbookclub.com/) and the [In Deep Water Report](https://in-deep-water.vercel.app/). I‚Äôll also be doing a deep dive into Next.js, React and TypeScript to build on my knowledge from the Founders and Coders curriculum. 

### Interesting links
These are some interesting links that I‚Äôve come across this month: 
- [CSS Weekly](https://css-weekly.com/) is a website that provides a weekly roundup of CSS related news, articles, tutorials, and resources. 
- Learn how to make [ten modern layouts](https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/) with just one of line of CSS each 
- [12factor.net](https://12factor.net/) is a website that describes a methodology for building applications that are scalable, maintainable, and resilient 
- [The Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) wants to change the way we view the web
