Building the Solidarity Knows No Borders website ‚úä Using AlpineJs to add interactivity to a web page ‚õ∞Ô∏è Finishing my new personal website üîó Beginning a project with NextJs and Sanity ‚è≠Ô∏è

### What I‚Äôve been working on
Over the past month I‚Äôve been mainly focused on building the Solidarity Knows No Borders website. This project is a WordPress site built with the Full Site Editor and a few custom components like an interactive map and an embedded Action Network sign up form. We will be launching the site soon and I‚Äôm really excited for people to see it. I‚Äôve also been learning how to create custom Gutenberg blocks in React and I‚Äôve started a mini project to create a filter block. There‚Äôs one remaining bug where the block validation is failing that I need to solve. Aside from development work I‚Äôve been learning about project management and have taken on the role of steward for a couple of projects at Common Knowledge. In my free time I‚Äôve finished my new personal website and I‚Äôm getting it ready to launch.

### What I‚Äôve been learning
This month I‚Äôve been learning how to:
- import an SQL file into a Docker container running a MySQL database
- convert JSON data into GeoJson to enable clustering on a Mapbox map
- connect Gravity Forms form submissions to an Action Network mailing list with n8n
- use Alpine Js‚Äô x-data and x-init directives to create a animation that cycles through a series of cards to encourage user interaction
- clone and adapt a NextJs and Sanity template and deploy it to Vercel

### What‚Äôs next
Over the next month I‚Äôm hoping to launch my new personal website and archive my current site. Prior to launch I‚Äôd like to add [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) as a web analytics tool and install the [Eleventy social share card generator plugin](https://github.com/tpiros/eleventy-plugin-social-share-card-generator) to make sure my links look good on social media. For my next personal project I‚Äôm building another portfolio website for my partner using NextJs and Sanity. This will be a good opportunity to learn how to use Sanity Studio and improve my TypeScript skills. At Common Knowledge I will be steward for a new interactive tool for an online feminist magazine and picking up some development work on an ecommerce website for Pluto Books. I would also like to package up my custom Gutenberg filtering block into a plugin for use on all Common Knowledge WordPress sites.
