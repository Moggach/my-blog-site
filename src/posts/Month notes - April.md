### What I‚Äôve been working on
I received my [apprenticeship](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/2) final grade in April and I‚Äôm very proud to say that I passed with a Merit. I‚Äôve signed a further contract with my apprenticeship employer [Common Knowledge](https://commonknowledge.coop/) so I‚Äôm now a Junior Engineer and looking forward to learning more with them over the next year.
Aside from that, I‚Äôve been adding features to [The World Transformed](https://theworldtransformed.org/) site in preparation for this year‚Äôs festival and doing some bug fixes for [The Left Book Club](https://leftbookclub.com/) - specifically to do with their Shopify integration.

###  What I‚Äôve been learning
This month I‚Äôve been learning how to:
- add a `.nvmrc` file to repositories to specify which Node version should be used with a project
- use the `linearGradient` element to recreate a Photoshop gradient map with an SVG
- use the [Wagtail Menus](https://wagtailmenus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) package to create different editable menus and custom menu templates for a site
- set up an SSH connection to a WordPress installation hosted on Kinsta and use git to clone a repo into it
- set up a Cron Job to run the Django command `publish_scheduled_pages` every half hour

### What‚Äôs next
In May I‚Äôll be finishing the SWARM website build. I will also be working on the new site for indigenous communications network Awasqa. I‚Äôm assisting a colleague with a WordPress site for The Architecture Lobby and I will likely be doing some additional devops support work for 350.org. I want to dedicate some personal time to creating a new personal site with a portfolio and migrating this blog. I haven‚Äôt decided yet which language or framework to use but I‚Äôm considering something like React and Sanity.io.
