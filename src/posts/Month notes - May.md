#### What I‚Äôve been working on

This month I‚Äôve been helping get [The World Transformed](https://theworldtransformed.org/) website ready for the launch of their 2023 festival. This included some site enhancements like allowing editors to customise background and text colours of streamfield blocks and adding a video player to the full width header image. I have continued supporting [350.org](https://350.org/) with their transition over to the [Bedrock pattern](https://roots.io/bedrock/) for their WordPress sites. This month we successfully recreated and deployed a production 350 site with this new stack. Finally, I‚Äôve been adapting the [Schematic WordPress theme](https://schematictheme.com/) so that it can be reused for the SWARM website redesign.

#### What I‚Äôve been learning
This month I‚Äôve been learning how to:
- programmatically fetch raw Shopify data using the [ShopWP](https://wpshop.io/) plugin and display it in a custom WordPress Gutenberg block
- use the poster attribute in the `video` element to display an image until the video content is ready to be played 
- retrieve data from a WordPress post field based on the post ID with the `get_post_field()` function 
- create section layouts in JSON for a custom WordPress theme
- add a color picker to the admin interface in a Django Wagtail project with the [django-colorfield](https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/django-colorfield) package 


#### What‚Äôs next
In June I‚Äôll be finishing my work on SWARM and preparing the site for launch. I am expecting to start a new project building a new site for indigenous communications network Awasqa. I‚Äôm taking a break towards the end of the month to work on personal projects including a new portfolio site that I hope to be porting this blog to soon.
