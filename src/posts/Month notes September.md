### What I‚Äôve been working on
This month I‚Äôve been helping to finish off the [Platform.org](https://platformlondon.org/) website ahead of its launch. This involved fixing some CSS bugs like box shadows being cut off when overflow-x is set to scroll and writing JavaScript to improve the UI by adding a counter to display the number of options selected on a filter. I‚Äôve been working on optimizing my WordPress workflow in general by making sure I‚Äôm using all of the possible styling options in theme.json and using the create block theme plugin. I also took part in some user testing sessions with the Figma prototype of the Solidarity Knows No Borders website. I set up the repository for this new project and started some initial development work like creating the header, footer and a custom post type. On my personal site I‚Äôve been designing and developing the landing page which you can view in progress on the staging site.

###  What I‚Äôve been learning
This month I‚Äôve been learning how to:
- use the create block theme plugin to quickly generate a block based WordPress theme 

- use eleventy collections to organize the content on my new website

- integrate google sheets with gravity forms so that form entries are automatically added to a designated google sheet

- add renovate to a repository to manage PHP composer dependencies 

- use the mapbox api and the carbon fields library to create a custom map component on a WordPress site

### What‚Äôs next
Over the next month I‚Äôm going to be the main developer building the Solidarity Knows No Borders website. The site will be a home for this community fighting for migrant justice & dignity and I‚Äôm very excited to be involved. I‚Äôm looking forward to building on my existing knowledge of WordPress Full Site Editor to build a beautiful and easy to use site within a limited timeframe and budget. There are some components in the design such as the map of member organizations and resources that need to be translated into multiple languages that will be technically challenging. It will be interesting to see how I can implement them and hopefully what I‚Äôve learnt into future projects. On my personal website I‚Äôm aiming to build my projects portfolio page which should display the best of my work over the last two years.
