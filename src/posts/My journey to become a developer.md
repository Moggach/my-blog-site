title: "My journey to becoming a developer"

I’ve worked in book publishing for eight years but I’ve loved it. I’ve [won awards](https://hub.londonbookfair.co.uk/trailblazer-awards-winners-revealed-by-the-london-book-fair-3/) (which is really nice and slightly embarrassing) and I’ve worked on some beautiful books. 

Now though I’m transitioning into becoming a software developer with [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/). If you’re interested in my journey this is how I got here...

### Dabbled with coding
I started dabbling with coding quite soon out of Uni and I even attended a course on Dreamweaver (when that was still widely used). I taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS which is what you needed at the time to make basic websites. I ventured into Javascript but found it quite scary without a maths or computing background. I kept coming back to it though mostly because I liked the elegance of coding. I realised it was all about finding the most efficient solution to a problem. 

### Made learning a habit
What really supercharged my interest in coding was when I made a commitment to practising it every day. Initially this was just a few minutes and I used the [Mimo](https://getmimo.com/) app. I worked my way through the HTML and CSS tutorials on [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and started reading [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/). This was when I properly started to grapple with Javascript and I found that persistence and googling were enough to see me through. The developer community also has a great ethos of sharing knowledge and constant learning which really inspired me. 

### Got involved with events and meetups
Eventually I started to get brave enough to talk to other people about what I was doing. I was a coach at the [2019 FutureBook Day of Code](https://dayofcode.co.uk/) which was a turning point for me in terms of trusting in my own abilities. I started attending (by then online) meetups at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) and [Founders and Coders](). At these events I got free support and tuition but I also connected to a group of people who had, or were,transitioning their careers towards software development. 

### Made projects
I think it’s really important to put your new skills into practice as soon as you can. I started making websites - including the one you’re reading this blog on which I built following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM&t=15148s). I tried to combine my existing skills and experience in publishing with coding so I also made a [React application](https://romantic-ardinghelli-5883b1.netlify.app/) that returns data from the Google Books API.
I created a [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Moggach) where I pushed my code and went through the whole process of building a site or application from  [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to hosting on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Joined FAC
Earlier this year I made the huge decision to apply to the [Founders and Coders bootcamp](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/). It was a lengthy application process and the requirements were tough. I knew though that even if I wasn't successful the learning I was gaining wouldn't be wasted. I am in the middle of the part time course now and it's already one of the best things I’ve ever done. In September I’ll be leaving my current job at Abrams & Chronicle Books (which I’ve loved and has supported me to take this step) to study at FAC full time and become a junior developer.

I hope that this has been interesting to read and has given you some insight or inspiration to start your own journey with coding!
