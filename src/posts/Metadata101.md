Pri partem possit convenire ad sed, mei labore epicuri oportere an, tation dissentiunt ius ex. Ut vix suas voluptua conclusionemque. Libris conceptam quo et, id cum graeco consequuntur. Alterum euismod salutatus cu usu, choro prompta eu cum. 

Ius dolores forensibus ne. Tollit prompta quaeque an duo, his *enim omnes soleat ad* 

### Pri partem eirmod appellantur te. Ius dolores forensibus ne.

Has ne summo assentior. Et iriure molestie abhorreant eos. Porro dicat nostro mea te, an dicam eripuit sed. Sit no utroque scribentur, per natum graeco in, per ei commune delicata theophrastus.

Without these elements the book will be lost among the hundreds of thousands published each year. When so much of UK bookselling takes place online this is a disaster.

### There are three basic types of metadata
1. Bibliographic data including title, author, description, format, subjects and audience.
2. Transactional data which cover the price, the UK supplier, availability, and any discounts.
3. Product rights data which list the territories where the book is allowed to be sold.

### But why is everyone talking about keywords?
Keywords are an important part of publishers' strategy for getting their books more visible on Amazon.

Similar to Twitter hashtags, keywords are words and phrases associated with the content of a book that make it more searchable online.

For example, for a children’s book about screen-free activities the keywords might be something like: activities; kids; screen-free; craft; fun; entertaining; educational; nature; games; projects; inspiration.

### So what can I do to improve my metadata?
There are lots of guidelines when it comes to creating good metadata. A good starting point is [BIC Basic](https://bic.org.uk/files/pdfs/090929%20What%20is%20BIC%20Basic.pdf)

It is really helpful to use ONIX to structure your metadata so that you can be sure you’re meeting industry standards. Publishing software company Consonance have a really great [introduction to ONIX](https://www.consonance.app/blog/a-non-technical-beginners-guide-to-onix-for-books)

Metadata is a huge and important topic. I hope you enjoy learning more about it.
