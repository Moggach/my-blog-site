###  What I‚Äôve been working on
This month has been dedicated to my final project for my apprenticeship - a rebuild of the [Common Knowledge website](https://alpha.commonknowledge.coop/). Working from designs created in Figma (by our co-op designer Gemma) I have created a CMS in the Django based framework Wagtail. I have also built custom HTML templates and a CSS theme with Tailwind. I‚Äôve written notes from each week of the project summarizing my main learnings which can be viewed [here](https://alpha.commonknowledge.coop/writing/) 

###  What I‚Äôve been learning
This month I've been learning how to:
- build custom Page models and StreamField blocks with Django and Wagtail
- write database queries with the Django ORM
- write end to end tests with Cypress and unit tests with Pytest
- use the Stimulus JavaScript framework with Django 
- use the Flowbite library for UI components 
- set up a staging site on Fly.io

### What‚Äôs next
In February I‚Äôll be moving onto other project work with Common Knowledge. I‚Äôll also be attending two interviews with the apprenticeship assessors.
