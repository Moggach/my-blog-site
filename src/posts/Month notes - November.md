#### What I‚Äôve been working on
This month has been full of a few different projects. 

- I‚Äôve started to build a new personal website in WordPress 
- I picked up some supporting work for the [FutureNatures](https://futurenatures.org/) website debugging some issues with a search and filter plugin
- Added the option for embedding [Shiny apps](https://www.shinyapps.io/) into pages on the [StopWatch](https://www.stop-watch.org/) site
- Common Knowledge is also working on a big redesign of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap](https://www.hotosm.org/) website and I‚Äôve been helping there with some UI components like a carousel slide and a newsletter sign up
- With our Project Manager I‚Äôve been planning and scoping the new Common Knowledge website - details below
- I took part in mock interviews with Founders and Coders to prepare for my assessed portfolio review in the near future

#### What I‚Äôve been learning
Over the past month I‚Äôve learnt how to:
- use [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) to build UI components with Tailwind CSS in Django templates
- use `meta_query` inside `WP_Query` to order and filter by custom meta fields 
- use the [Stimulus Carousel](https://stimulus-carousel.stimulus-components.com/) package (built on top of Swiper.js) to create a responsive carousel component. One really cool thing about this is the customisable SwiperOptions. In this case I used them to determine the number of slides displayed based on screen size
- create a custom EmbedFinder class in a Django application 

#### What‚Äôs next
In December I‚Äôll be working exclusively on my final project which will be a redesign and rebuild of the Common Knowledge website. This project and its documentation will form the second half of my grade for my apprenticeship. I‚Äôll be the primary developer on this project which involves migrating the current Gatsby site with content in Markdown to the Django Wagtail CMS.
I‚Äôll be aiming to make a maintainable, performant and accessible website that will serve the business needs of Common Knowledge.

#### Interesting links
These are some interesting links that I‚Äôve come across this month.
- [Figma Tailwind CSS](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/785619431629077634) - this plugin converts a Figma design directly into a Tailwind theme.js file for use in your projects
- [Storybook for Django](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storybook-django) - this is a UI development environment for Django components. Create and test UI components in isolation from your Django views.
- [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) - a design magazine on all aspects of web design with a special focus on web standards and best practices
- [Hemmingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) - this app identifies lengthy, complex sentences and other mistakes to make your writing clearer.
