### What I‚Äôve been working on
This month I‚Äôve been working on a Google Analytics integration with the Left Book Club website. This involved migrating to Google Analytics 4 and setting up custom events to measure ecommerce events such as purchases and subscriptions on the site. I‚Äôve been completing design QA tickets on the SWARM website and finishing pages like search and category index pages as well as thinking about how to add an application form page that won‚Äôt be indexed by search engines. Finally, I‚Äôve begun working on my personal portfolio site with static site generator Eleventy.

###  What I‚Äôve been learning
This month I‚Äôve been learning how to:
- Use the WordPress Full Site Editor to develop fully customisable block based themes.
- Use feComponentTransfer to create a duotone filter effect on images
- Integrate existing layouts and styles into WordPress plugin AJAX Load More via a repeater template
- Extend the inbuilt Query Loop Block in WordPress by registering a block variation
- Display Mapbox data in a custom Gutenberg block with library CarbonFields and plugin Mapster WP Maps

### What‚Äôs next
In July I want to get an MVP of my personal portfolio site online. I will also be moving this blog across to the new site so next month's notes will be posted there ‚≠ê I will be helping  finish off the build for the Architecture Lobby website. I am expecting to start work on a website redesign and build for Solidarity Knows No Borders which is a campaign group and coalition run by Migrants Organise.
